Style: Minecraft HD-2D pixel art with professional CAD precision. BUILDINGS ONLY - completely exclude roads, vegetation, terrain, street furniture, neighboring structures. Buildings rendered as solid cubic block structures using authentic Minecraft materials: stone blocks, wood planks, glass blocks, brick patterns with crisp pixelated HD textures and sharp geometric edges. CRITICAL TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: Measure and annotate ALL dimensions using Google Maps scale reference with architectural precision. Include comprehensive dimensional annotations for EVERY element: building width/length/height, individual room dimensions, wall thicknesses, window/door measurements, roof sections, foundation depths, structural details. Display measurements in BOTH formats: millimeter units (e.g., 18000 mm) AND decimal meter notation (e.g., 18.00 m). Add mandatory 'ROOF ANGLE 45°' annotations for all roof structures. Draw professional dimension lines with arrows, extension lines, numerical labels, and detail callouts. Position north indicator compass and scale reference at RIGHT EDGE. Completely remove Google logos, imagery text, watermarks, and location names. Generate architectural illustration matching sample/2025-05-01-0024-isometric.png quality with comprehensive CAD-grade dimensional precision for architect reference.

Style: Advanced cyber-futuristic isometric hologram with luminous cyan and electric blue wireframe buildings (#00FFFF, #0080FF) on deep navy space background (#001122). BUILDINGS ONLY - completely exclude roads, vegetation, terrain, street furniture, neighboring structures. Buildings rendered as transparent glowing wireframe structures revealing internal architectural framework, structural elements, and room divisions. CRITICAL TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: Preserve ALL original CAD measurements and dimensional annotations as bright glowing neon text in cyan/blue colors. Include comprehensive dimensional annotations: building width/length/height, wall thicknesses, window/door measurements, roof sections, structural details in BOTH millimeter units (e.g., 18000 mm) AND decimal meter notation (e.g., 18.00 m). Add mandatory 'ROOF ANGLE 45°' annotations for all roof structures in holographic text. Maintain voxel grid system with professional dimension lines, arrows, extension lines as glowing wireframe elements. Include floating data panels, scanning lines, digital overlay effects, and technical readouts. Position north indicator compass and scale reference at RIGHT EDGE. Add subtle particle effects and holographic distortion while preserving dimensional accuracy. Completely remove Google logos, imagery text, and location names.

      "prompt_template": "Generate a professional 3D monochrome technical line art architectural drawing from Google Maps data at EXACTLY 45° viewing angle. CRITICAL COLOR REQUIREMENTS: Use ONLY pure black lines (#000000) on pure white background (#FFFFFF) for ALL building elements - ABSOLUTELY NO COLORS, GRAYS, SHADING, OR SHADOWS on buildings. EXCEPTION: Dimension lines and measurement annotations ONLY use #125ae0 blue color to clearly differentiate from structural elements. BUILDINGS ONLY - completely exclude roads, vegetation, terrain, street furniture, neighboring structures. Buildings rendered as precise 3D wireframe structures showing all architectural edges, framework, and internal divisions. Line weight specifications: THICK lines (3-4px) for main building outlines and primary structural edges, MEDIUM lines (2px) for internal divisions and secondary structure, THIN lines (1px) for fine architectural details. Add extensive cross-hatching and parallel line patterns using black lines to indicate surface planes and create strong 3D depth perception. CRITICAL TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: Include comprehensive dimensional annotations for ALL elements: building width/length/height, wall thicknesses, window/door measurements, roof sections, foundation depths, structural details in BOTH millimeter units (e.g., 18000 mm) AND decimal meter notation (e.g., 18.00 m) using #125ae0 blue text. Add mandatory 'ROOF ANGLE 45°' annotations in blue. Draw professional dimension lines with arrows and extension lines in #125ae0 blue. Maintain 45° isometric viewing angle with north indicator compass at RIGHT EDGE. Show buildings with clearly defined front, side, and top faces using varied hatching patterns to differentiate roof planes, wall surfaces, and structural elements. Use strong line weight variation and extensive hatching for enhanced 3D visualization. Completely remove Google logos, imagery text, and location names. Create clean technical architectural line drawing with comprehensive dimensional accuracy and strong 3D representation. Location context: ${location}"

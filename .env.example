# Note for Production Deployment on YouWare MCP:
# ==========================================
# When deploying to YouWare MCP, you don't need to set these environment variables.
# YouWare MCP automatically handles authentication through the runtime context.
# The application will detect and use the MCP authentication automatically.

# For debugging authentication issues:
# 1. Use the debug panel (bug icon in bottom-left corner) to check authentication status
# 2. The debug panel will show which authentication method is being used
# 3. Download the debug report for detailed analysis
